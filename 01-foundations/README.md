# Level 1: Foundations

Build ML fundamentals using only numpy. No sklearn, no magic.

## Modules

1. **Linear Regression** - Fit a line to data, understand least squares
2. **Gradient Descent** - The optimization algorithm behind everything
3. **Logistic Regression** - Classification from scratch
4. **Loss Functions** - Why different problems need different objectives

## What You'll Learn

- How models actually "learn" (spoiler: it's just math)
- Why gradient descent works
- The difference between regression and classification
- How to debug when things go wrong
